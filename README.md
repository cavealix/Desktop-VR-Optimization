# Performance Bounceback Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

# About
Built by Alix Cave 
System: HTC Vive Pro 
Time: This project took about 48 hours of developement. 
Pro: I appreciate the guidance the rubric provided since there were quite a number of areas for performance diagnosis and improvement.
Con: None that I can think of.

# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to practice your newly learned optimization skills. You’ll be given a VR game that is extremely unperformant, and use your talents to optimize it to a consistent 90fps.

# Why this project?
Performance optimization is one of the most important skillsets for a VR developer, since apps running below the target framerate are essentially unplayable, causing nausea and discomfort. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a VR game has been hastily built with a focus on functionality rather than performance (a common approach while prototyping). You’ve been hired to take the game and make it a performant app ready for release.

# What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Using static and dynamic batching
Optimizing physics
Creating object pools
Caching variables and optimizing code
Setting up lighting with MSAA
Baking lighting
Using light probes
Using the profiler for performance optimization

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
